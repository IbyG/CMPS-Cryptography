## Not Done

## Randomized Vigenere

#### Overview:

This slight alteration of the original Vigenère cipher that was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553 will allow us to create a more secure version of the cipher, leveraging the power of computers and random number generation. The original version of the Vigenère cipher used a tableau that contained 26 alphabets, each differing by a shift of one.
