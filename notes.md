__Prop__
1. For every `a != 0`, `a|0` and `a|a`, also `1|b` for every `b`
2. if `a|b` and `b|c` , then `a|c`
3. If `a|b` and `a|c`, then `a|sb + tc` for any `s,t exists in Ints`

- A number `p > 1` that is divisible only by 1 and itself is called prime.
- An integer that is not prime is called composite, that `n=ab`, where `1 < a,b < n`

__Thm__
```
There are infinitely many prime numbers.
```

__Thm__
```
Let Pi(n) be the number of primes less than n. Then Pi(x) = x / log(x) (approx)

ratio Pi(x) / (x / ln(x)) -> 1 as x -> infinity

```

__Thm__
```
For every positive integer is a product of primes. The factorization is unique up to order.
